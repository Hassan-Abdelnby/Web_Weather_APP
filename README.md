🌤️ Weather Application – Codveda Internship Task  

This project is part of my Front-End Development Internship at Codveda Technologies.  
It showcases how to integrate a **REST API** into a front-end project to display real-time data.  

## 🚀 Features
- Search weather by city name.  
- Display temperature, humidity, and wind speed.  
- Dynamic weather icons based on current conditions.  
- Responsive card-style UI design.  


## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- HTML5  
- CSS3  
- JavaScript (Fetch API)  
- OpenWeather API  

## 🎯 Internship Context
This project was developed as **Task 2 (API Integration)** during my internship with **Codveda Technologies**.  
It demonstrates my ability to work with external APIs, fetch & display live data, and build responsive UI components.  

⚠️ **Note:** For security reasons, the OpenWeather API key is not included in this repository.  
To run the demo, please add your own API key in `script.js`.
